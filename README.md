# Voice Chatbot - AI English Practice Assistant 🎙️🤖

A fully local voice chatbot with two conversation modes: **Classic Chat** and **Live Mode**. Built to help practice English conversation skills through natural AI interactions.

## About This Project 💡

I created this chatbot as a personal tool to:
- **Practice my English** through realistic conversations
- **Learn more** about AI integration, speech processing, and UI development
- Experiment with real-time streaming and voice activity detection
